# Gunyoung's First CS193 Homework

## My favorite things about CS 19300
- **The TAs are chill**
- The class teaches you _things that will be useful for the rest of my life_ if I were to choose to become a developer
- CS193 is, for now, a slow paced class that revolves mostly around our individual work, **allowing self pacing**.
- _**One lecture per week!**_
